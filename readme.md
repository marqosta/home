the intention is to build a good looking, elegant website, where I can sell some
of the artworks  i make. :)

IDEAS (04242020):
    1 - want a dropbox under each of the navbar words when hover
    2 - want a television video noise effect on the navbar on hover
    3 - an easter egg on tha frontpage avatar (hidden button to page with music? only way to acchieve it. sounds cool)
